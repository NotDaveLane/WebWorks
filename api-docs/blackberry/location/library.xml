    <details title="Gears GeoLocation Recommendation">
      You should use the Gears GeoLocation object instead of the blackberry.location object.  The blackberry.location object
      is a legacy object.  The GeoLocation object is much more functional and has many more desired features.

          Once onLocationUpdate() has been invoked, the callback occurs whenever there is an update to the location
          information. This can be as frequent as once every several seconds. If you have passed a function to the method, you
          can cancel the callback using location.removeLocationUpdate(). If you have passed a string, the
          callback cannot be removed.

        <details>
          The refreshLocation() method requests an update of the location of the BlackBerry device.
          This method is asynchronous, so the script continues regardless of whether updated location information has been
          received. To ensure that location information is updated before reading it, you should first register a listener using
          location.onLocationUpdate() that reads location.latitude and location.longitude,
          and call refreshLocation() afterwards.

        <details>
          The device can obtain location information in one of three ways:
        </details>
        <details>
          Cellsite = 0 This method uses the GPS location of the active cellsite tower to provide first order GPS information. It
          provides the least accurate location information; however, it is the fastest location mode.
          Note: This location method requires network connectivity and carrier support.
        </details>
        <details>
          Assisted = 1 This method uses the network to provide ephemeris satellite data to the device chip. It provides the GPS
          location faster than the autonomous mode and more accurately than the cellsite mode.
          Note: This location method requires network connectivity and carrier support.
        </details>
        <details>
          Autonomous = 2 This method uses the GPS chip on the BlackBerry device without assistance from the network. The
          autonomous mode provides the first GPS location in the slowest amount of time.
